        <p>evy does not store anything about you. Period.</p>
        <p>evy uses the Spotify API to access your liked songs. Your liked songs are processed when creating your running playlist, but they are not saved. No personal information from your Spotify account is saved. It could be that your IP ends up in my access logs, but these logs are regularly cleaned out and I do not care to look at them anyway.</p>
        <p>If you want to make sure evy no longer has access to your Spotify account, remove it from your <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/apps/" target="_blank">connected apps</a>.</p>
        <p>Still not convinced? Read through evy's source code on <a href="https://github.com/AntheSevenants/evy" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
